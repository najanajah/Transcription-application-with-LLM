Alright, so now — now we’ll start, okay? Ahh just a couple of questions ah…How long have you been working in Tan Tock Seng?
 I guess that’s—s – so if you talk about am I being employed in Tan Tock Seng is just—
 Umm I guess from the time you were an MO or the—you did your—
 S—So I did my HO—
 —residency here?
 —here.
 Ahh, okay.
 So, 2004, I was here…ahh…for a while, then I did anaesthesia in NUH.
 Ahh.
 So in two thousand—So I did two postings of my House Officer training here, then I went to NUH do anaesthesia, then I went to do army.
 Ahh, okay.
 Then I did two years of pathology in NUH.
 Ahhh, okay.
 Oka—(laughs a bit) So it’s a bit long, then I decided that I would come back to Tan Tock Seng…
 Mm, and did your…
 To do internal medicine. So then I did most of my internal medicine training here,—
 Mm.
 I did—In fact all my internal medicine training here, plus…uhhh…then my endocrine training. So, my endocrine training largely here except six months in ___KTPH_____.
 Okay.
 So I’ve been…working here and there…mmm…maybe about…8 years, around there, —
 Mm.
 —around there. So I’ve graduated about 12 years.
 Mm.
 Two years was in army, two years was in pathology, and half a year was anaesthesia—so around seven plus eight  years
 So you’ve been in the same endocrine department for…
 Uh, since 2012…September, something like that, so about….eh…4 years plus
 Ahh I see, okay.
 Except for a six month period when I went KTPH_________(mumbling)___.
 So,  you very probablyy identify yourself pretty much as a Tan Tock Seng person
 Yeah yes.
 Yeah, okay. What are your current roles…you know, umm, in your… in your work here at TTS?
 What are my current roles ah.
 Yeah. So you’ve got your clinical…uhh…responsibilities? Umm…
 Work…So most doctors have the teaching part so they teach medical students for both s—both medical schools. Now some Duke on and off but largely is LKC and Yong Loo Lin. And then there’s the…ah…the junior residents…the junior—the HOs and MOs, and then there’s the senior residents as well, the registrar levels. So there’s the…ah…endocrinology for the senior—for the—registrar level and then the HOs and MOs when you…
 Ah…so you do—
 y—either cover the department or when you cover general medicine you also…
 Ah okay. So you do quite a bit of teaching
 Mm…I think everybody does
 Everybody has to do, right. (laughs)
 Everybody does yeah everybody does that kind of thing, it’s not—
 Ahh okay…
 —something that…uhh…and then there’s also…here and there we do a little bit of…poster do—posters…and some paper writing—not that much. There’s a…significant component of administration also, so I also help to… organise some of the division of medicine call things.
 Mm…the roster…
 The…particularly the MO rosters…ah…
 Uh-huh.
 Ah…As well as some of the outbreak…response rosters and…umm…we’re looking now at…maybe the civil emergency rosters—
 Uh-huh.
 —a little bit. There’s also a significant portion of work that is, uh, clinical work—like quality work?
 Ahh.
 So, like…improving diabetes care in the hospital…
 Diabetes care…(laughs)
 Yeah, nowadays it’s—it’s—
 Yeah, there’s—(laughs)
 —it’s all the rage now. (laughs) Including safety of, uhh, medications…as well as, uhh, improving inpatient blood sugar control that kind of thing.
 Mm.
 Like (mumbling).
 Okay.
 So—it’s all different parts And then each part got their own separate parts and then it’s quite…
 Yeah. Yeah. I—I—I guess we’ll be touching on those things…a little later on in the interview la, okay? Umm…so how—how would you identify yourself based on these roles, primarily it’s the condition? Or you know like, half here, half there, or…if I had to ask you, you know, what’s your identity, what would you think of?
 I think…I ok—me first probably as a clinician, since t—that k—that was my training and my…
 Mm.
 …what I was actually taught. Actually the rest of the stuff we don’t really get so much training. We do get some, but not that much. So largely…even though I like doing more the other stuff, large—
 So you like the non-clinical stuff?
 Quite a bit la, I mean there’s some I quite like doing it…ahm…because…it gives some variety to the work—
 (laughs)
 —and system level change is quite interesting because…
 Mm-hm.
 You actually get to make changes which...ahh…may last a little bit longer and affect more people at a time ah.
 Rather than just seeing one patient and _____.
 One patient, one patient, one patient, one patient…yeah.
 Yeah.
 Though it is important to do clinical work, because you don’t do clinical work, you lose touch with what you actually need to do, how to teach, what kind of research to do, yeah—you—there must be some clinical work because you—if one doesn’t do clinical work then it becomes very difficult to…
 Mm.
  …see the need.
 Yeah. Let me tell you a bit about ah our project.
 Mm.
 Okay, so uhm…Actually Michelle Jong is pretty interested in this, and what we’re doing is, uhh, thinking about…you know, what are the skills and capabilities that clinicians need to solve complex problems that are not clinical problems. So I—I think uhh—so I was rea—actually pretty glad to hear that, oh, you like doing all the non-clinical stuff. Because that’s the area that we want to talk about, yeah.
 Mm.
 We talk to clinicians a lot of times, they think “Oh, complex problems must be, you know, complex clinical problems,” but we’re looking for people who can solve complex problems, uh….not involving necessarily just patients, but also working with a spectrum of…uh, partners in healthcare,
 Mm-hm.
 Okay, might be from other departments, other institutions, umm…
 Mm.
 And also working—being able to navigate within the system, the healthcare system itself, okay. So, uhh, that’s what we’re trying to do. Uhh, and….you mentioned some of your work already, uhm…in diabetes? Right, and also in the…umm…uh, MO rosting…roster planner.
 Mm.
 Yeah. And I think those are good examples of non-clinical work, where you have to interact with different people, and sometimes you solve problems that you’ve never seen before, and I think it’s a good point you brought up that, uhh, you were never trained for this in medical school.
 Mm.
 Right, to somehow be able to campaign, launch a campaign, and then bring about awareness, about diabetes and helping patients be aware of all this. Umm, so I—I’m actually gonna ask you umm…thinking about your work in let’s say…which—which do you think would be a good example of a complex or a…a challenging situation that you had to tackle? So let’s say…the diabetes work. Would there actually be quite a complex problem?
 There are a lot of them I—you’re looking for an example you can go deeper—
 Mm. Yeah.
 —into to look for a…
 Yeah.
 So y—
 Where you have to work with, like, many people across different professional groups, uhh…
 So the diabetes problem is quite uhh…quite a big issue. Which we can go into because it’s—there’s—haven’t—we haven’t found a good solution to it yet—
 (laughs) Okay.
 But I think we’ve found that…it requires…many, many different parts to all work together, and it is going to be probably one of these multi-year kind of things, and then it’s difficult to pinpoint any one measure that improve things drastically, but it’s probably multiple things happening over time, and then gradually improving the situation ah, probably something like that.
 I think that’s a perfect example of a—
 Yeah.
 —complex problem where you got—
 Yes.
 —many different…uhhh parts of it, and umm…it’s a complex system because if you change one part it will…you know, 
 Yes. Correct.
 —have a cascading effect on other parts as well. Yeah. And also that, you know, there is no…one correct way to do it, everybody has to try and figure out—
 Yes.
 —as you go along so I—I think that’s a very good example (laughs) of a complex problem.
 Yes. (laughs)
 Yeah. Okay. Umm…So if you think about the—the work that needs to be done in diabetes, could you just, like, sketch out the landscape for me, what’s this big project about diabetes? What’s your role in it, also?
 Okay. So it depends on which level we look at it.
 Okay.
 So there is…diabetes at the RHS level, —
 Mm-hm.
 —the Regional Health System which is…a bit…probably too high level that—but—basically they want to improve the…uhhh…in—the…they want to prevent diabetes, and they want to make sure that the people who do have diabetes get detected early, and those who are detected early that they receive good care, and those who have complications that the rate of complication progression is retarded, and those that are near death…(mumbling). So, basically, it’s a whole spectrum of diabetes work.
 Mm-hmm.
 That’s a bit high level.
 Mm-hmm.
 So what we’re doing um at the hospital level is at least, largely now we’re considering a inpatient work, though there is some outpatient work as well that is starting to come about. Inpatient is…a bit like…lower lying fruit. It’s a little bit easier inpatient because you have a little bit more control, outpatient tends to be a little bit, uhh, difficult, more difficult. So inpatient work is actually generally easier, so actually a lot of our work now is targeted on inpatient, but subsequently we are starting to move towards outpatient work, so, we’re talking about inpatient work, right.
 Mm.
 Inpatient work I see it as...two big…uhh, now we’re looking at two big parts ah, one is to improve the blood s—sugar contr—blood glucose control of…the—all the hospitalised inpatients 
 All?
 All the—
 Not just yours?
 —hospitalised patients, not just mine, because…umm…even if I can improve my own hospitalised inpatient blood sug— blood glucose, umm that’s only a small percentage of the whole hospital and then—
 Mm.
 —if you want to do a big thing you do a big thing
(both laugh)
 So then there’s another group—there’s another m—thing that we want to do is to try and reduce the prescription error rates ah, there’s a lot of…there are a lot of uhh…small errors that are made, some of which can be quite dangerous.
 Mm.
 Uhm…with regard to prescribing insulin and all these things. So that requires…another—so one is to prevent errors,—
 Mm.
 —and one is to…um, improve the blood sugar control so this…be—be…making the blood—high blood sugars low, and making—making sure that when you’re bringing down the blood sugars, you don’t create…blood sugars that are too low.
 Mm-hmm.
 Because when you’re bringing down the medication, a lot of times patients actually end up having too low blood sugars, and that’s dangerous.
 Mm.
 So that’s uhh…a problem, that’s why people don’t treat the high blood sugars aggressively because they are too worried about the low blood sugars, and that sort of thing.
 Ahh, okay.
 So it is a very complex problem because not only do you have to deal with medication, so…blood—high blood pressure and cholesterol is easier, because the medications are—you just have to give the medication, the blood pressure usually will come down, the cholesterol usually will come down, that’s not so complicated.
 Then you just stabilize…
 The problem with blood sugar is that you have to give the medication and it involves the food, and the medications and the food are very closely related. And…there are a lot of parts of the food and the medication correlation which make it very complex and involve everybody, that’s the reason why it is complex to control inpatient blood sugar—blood glucose, yes.
 Ahh, okay. I see. So what’s your role in all this effort Ah, sorry, yes, my role.
 Yeah. 
 So my role now, there are a few roles ah, I have, okay. One is because—
 (laughs)
 —so—so—so there are different parts which I—okay so there’s uh—I’m…I’m an e—e—endocrinologist so that means I actually hav—I actually… some patients that I actually see…on my own so I—as a clinician I actually have some patients of my own, right.
 Mm.
 So…umm…when I review the blue letters, or I run the inpatient diabetes care team, or have my own general medicine patients, I have to take care of my own patients. On the other hand there’s the thing which I’m doing for the hospital.
 Mm-hm.
 So as part of the hospital work, there is a…portion of which which is…okay, wait, so there were a number of projects that we were doing, —
 Mm-hmm.
 One of which was uh in—integrated diabetes control, a care program, which we…put up an HSTP application at MOH for. So in essence we’re gonna build a system to stratify diabetes patients based on their computer records—
 Oh, okay.
 —into a few categories. And…we are going to target each of these categories separately.
 Okay.
 So high risk patients will be looked after directly by endocrinologists, medium risk patients will be done separately and then low risk patients will be…
 So, based on s—stratification.
 Okay, so that’s what I’m doing, uh, primary stratification.
 Yeah.
 And then, there’s some manpower to do this work.
 Mm.
 So the manpower involves pharmacists, doctors, data collection, people,—
 Ahh.
 —and all these things. So th—that’s one part. That’s…that’s par—the one part. There was another project that I was involved in, which is the Singapore Healthcare Improvement project.
 Mm.
 This is actually to reduce rate of harm, reduce harm
 Mm-hm.
 In patients when they enter the hospital. So this is largely to try and reduce the number of low blood sugars that were found in…um…the h—
 Mm.
 —the hospital. So, uh, that part…a lot of it was nursing driven.
 Okay.
 Mainly because it was also a little bit lower lying fruit. Nurses…uhhh the…uh way when nurse-ing wants to ch—nursing wants to change something, it—the—the cascade is much better…uhh, as in if you wanna—if the senior nurse agrees that this should be changed, and they work out a…peaceable process ah, by which this can be changed, it—the—the change is much faster. The roll out is better because the hierarchy is clearer.
 Ahh.
 You know what I’m trying to say?
 Yeah.
 Doctors tend to be a little bit more tricky and this is the part which we are now deali—trying to do. Okay?
 Mm-hmm.
 So, to improve the—so it’s—I know it’s a bit complicated because if you actually try and do a clear cut structure of who is involved in what ah, exactly—we’ve already tried drawing it and it became too complicated so…we…
 (laughs)
 So I understand, it’s back to you, so I’m just trying to see what actually you—you really need so like I did this project which involve the nurses and what nursing processes we’ll change and now we’re now moving on to the medical processes we’ll change—
 Mm.
 —and these two projects are actually very closely interrelated.
 Ahh, I see.
 Okay. And I’m also the clinical champion for the hypoglycaemia care pathway that is…a more smaller, more self contained thing.
 Mm-hm.
 Yeah. So I’m not sure what exactly—
 Okay.
 —what you’re looking for so—
 I…guess we’re looking for something which is challenging…uhh, because you have to work with many different…uhh groups of people, different groups of people. Uhh, and also because… uhh the problem, you never encountered this problem before, or it may be something that you’ve never been trained in.
 Mm.
 Yeah.
 So I think both are…okay? Uh so we—we can talk about improving the blood glucose control…
 Mm-hm.
 For all the hospitalised inpatients—
 Okay.
 —and how we started off doing it…do you—
 Mm. Okay.
 —you want to know the—what happened first,—
 Uhh…
 —what happened next, or do you really want to know—
 No. Actually uh—
 —yeah. Ah.
 I want to know what’s the most challenging situation you had in that project. And—and why was it challenging. If you think of your projects, they seem very complex. Err—
 The—the—
 —Or what was the most difficult part?
 The most difficult part is first i—I—I think it’s…identify—okay so there’re—the difficult part is…often to identify the main problem that you need to solve. So I know there’s— there’s this problem that you wanna improve the blood sugar, but then you first need, below that, you actually go and—need to go and dig…as what is causing the prob—the—what is causing the problem. You need to do some…
 A—A breakdown of what—
 Breakdown of what causes—
 —factors is, is it?
 Yes.
 Ah, okay.
 And then the s—next part you need to do is you need to decide on some strategy.
 (laughs)
 And deciding on the strategy—because it’s ver—it’s easier to…tsk, okay.
 Mm-hmm.
 You can either choose to use the…uh,h there’s some departments for example when they wanna do quality work it’s always… “I tell you you do this, don’t do this, then I will keep telling you and keep hitting you,” and…then I’ll say “Oh, yeah I’ll fine you,” or maybe, you know, “We’ll reward people who do well,” and…so is this the way we want t—to go about doing it, is education the way we want to go about doing it, is the carrot and stick approach the way we want to go about doing it?
 Mm.
 You know what I mean? Do you want to go about it targeting the diet side first, or the (laughs)…
 Mm-hmm.
 You know? So—So there are a lot of small things, but the small things are not so difficult, once you got the big picture right.
 Yeah.
 So how did we go about? A lot of it currently…
 Mm-hm.
 Is uh…You need to actually go and dig into the problem. And then after that you think which you can do with your current resource. So you first need to size the problem, size your resource, ask your team members, and then you know (mumbles and laughs)…um, in the end—
 So you—
 —whether it’s useful for you, whether you know all these things, yeah.
 Wha—what do you mean, uh, dig into the problem?
 So we need to…first analyse the problem more in-depth—so we know that there’s a problem. Some blood—patients’ blood sugars are very high. Or some patients’ blood sugars are very low.
 Mm.
 But what actually caused this problem? You need to actually go and dig into the problem, find out what is the cause, then after that come up with some strategies to solve the problem.
 Okay.
 So a lot of times when we don’t actually do that, people assume that this is the cause, assume that that is the cause, and then there’s no actual solution you see.
 Ahh.
 So there’s a lot of uh assumption going on, but until we actually have data, I realised that data is a big part of it A lot of problems, multi-disciplinary problems, right, you actually must have some data to show doctors, nurses, whatever, whoever (mumbling) to show that—
 How—how do you go about actually doing all this? Looks like a lot of research is required.
 So we…uhh… have some plan, so s—we need to have people to help us pull out…the patients who have low blood sugars for example.
 Mm.
 And then somebody—so previously it was me bu they are trying to get more people.
 Mm-hmm.
 To dig—go inside, go and look at the…the diet charts, go and look at the blood sugar chart, medication chart, go and correlate the timings and to see, “Oh, this patient became low bloo—have low blood sugar because of what reason.” And then…then we write down all this and we look at it, “Oh, it seems to be that a lot of people have low blood sugar because of this reason.” Then, we think of ways we can try and tackle this. You know, this problem. Maybe the patient doesn’t want to eat well, but then the blood—the medicine was still served.
 Ahh, okay.
 So…Yeah. So then, why—what do you do when the medicines are still served and the ___ very low blood sugar?
 Yeah.
 And the medicines a lot of times is served before the patient eats.
 Okay.
 So the medicine is served before the patient eats, then how do you know how much the patient is gonna eat, and all the—so there are a lot of, uhh, small issues here, um, that we slowly have to deal with and all very difficult though not ver—don’t seem very big, but all not very easy.
 It all contributes—
 Yes.
 —to the final problem.
 And I think what is important is that I realised the importance of seeing…of getting perspectives from different disciplines. Because you find that there are certain things that the doctor will just…I use—so the reason why I do this, I’ve been doing this…
 Mm.
 Because I used to complain to my HOD and say, “Tsk, you know this one, how come it’s like that, how come like that” then he said “oh…” then—so— because at that time they were coming up with this project and they wanted to see…uhh…w…they wanted to find a volunteer and then the time when department was very stressed so he said “Okay okay, I think since you have all these questions right, I think it is very good for you to do this.”
 (laughs)
 So I k—found—found it very useful because…I found it very useful because I realised that doctors don’t really know what the nurses do. Nurses often don’t really know what the doctors do. And if we actually communicate, we actually can find a way to make the system on the ground work. It’s just that we need to actually figure out, will there be problems—it’s j—I—I can assume that if I do this, I write this protocol in this way, the nurses should be able to follow. But then if you ask the nurse, the nurse she say, “Actually no ah, if you write like that, then the nurse on the ground will think like this.” Then you…then you realise that, oh, actually may not work so well, then you have to readjust and…it takes longer but I think the final outcome is generally a little bit better.
 Mm. Yeah.
 Yeah, so I’m not sure…
 Okay.
 A lot of it is, uh, I think the difficulty is…because…okay, so the difficulty is in identifying the problem, in identifying the strategy and because the strategy will involve multiple disciplines.
 Mm.
 Because we also went to kitchen. Because—
 Okay.
 —even kitchen is involved in the diet,
 Yeah.
 —and you make sure the nurse can identify those with medications early, so those with…who uh need insulin before meals, we have to ask kitchen to go and pack the diet, and then what time the diet comes up from the kitchen, because it cannot set all the diet up at one time, it must be…
 Mm.
 So some wards will have the diet late, some wards will have the diet early, so sometimes that causes issues…so the—there are all these things so that’s the reason why—
 Yes. (laughs)
 —it became a very big massive…and then the thing is that there are also constraints…
 Mm-hmm.
 …that you cannot…for example…okay ah, let me—let me try and…You cannot for example say that you want to do this then you must do this because there are also financial constraints, there are also people need to go off at a certain time, so the kitchen cannot prepare dinner at 8 o’clock for you if you want, because the kitchen staff need to OT…it’s just that I didn’t realise there’re—
 Mm, mm.
 —didn’t really think through that there are all these problems but you realise when you actually do things over, yeah actually it’s hard on the kitchen staff, then now they have to stay until 8 o’clock, (mumbling). Then you think, yeah that’s true ah, so you need to try and work around whatever constraints you have ah. So…there are—because there are so many people involved, so many constraints, to decide on the right strategy becomes difficult.
 Yeah. Because there are so many ways…
 Yes.
 Which you will need to actually work. Right.
 And because you don’t really know which one will work, so you need to pilot some…
 Mm.
 Ways, but sometimes, yeah. S—S—So it’s actually not very easy, and then you wanna find out which one can actually be, uh spread to the whole hospital.
 Mm.
 And buil—
 Should find wh—what is—
 Yeah.
 —a scalable way of working.
 Yes. That’s right.
 Yeah. What—What do you think—You’ve talked a lot about the …uh… challenges and I think you’ve given me a very good idea of…all the different parts that are involved in this, and eh you know, uh…what the different constraints are. So, now that you’ve had to work through all this, what are the capabilities or what skills did you have in order to kind of try and overcome these problems?
 Skills that I have ah? (laughs)
 Yeah. Or what did you have to employ What did you have to do?
 What did I have to do? Okay so, I did some admin while I was in army.
 Ah okay.
 Um…that helped me understand certain things. It helped me understand the importance of perception.
 Hmm?
 So, you can be correct, but if you’re perceived to be wrong, it doesn’t matter whether you’re correct or not. You know what I’m trying to say?
 So, how people perceive you.
 Yes. It’s more about ho—
 Ho—How they ____.
 Yeah, how they f—how you—ah how it is perceived th—how you come across.
 Mm.
 That’s very important, I think. The second thing I learnt is things about writing papers lah, putting papers up to forum lah, why must there be approval process, you cannot just decide you want to do this then you just do it. You need to—
 Oh like a med board.
 Ah, for example you may yeah why is there a process?  And what is the importance of this process? And how this generally goes in big organizations.
 Mm.
 So this, my SAF experience did help me to do that, understand that part,…
 Mm.
 …And what structure, what is this person l—so for example you want to ask for approval you need to find out oh this person is what role, what role does he play in the hospital, why do I need to consult him, what are the things he is think about, what are he s—his err—
 Mm.
 —considerations, when I approach him what will he be worried about that I should try and address before I speak to him, so I can say “Oh, yeah, I know you’re worried about this this this, but then actually…um…don’t have to worry about this because we’ve already…” you know, so…saves time when we actually meet
 Yeah. So sounds like the admin experience actually helped you a lot.
 Yes.
 What about any, any, like—
 There’s another group of uh—
 —capabilities or what—
 So what—
 —skills did you have to bring to the table?
 Besides that right, of course the endocrinology part is important. Because first, you need to know what the bi—the science is.
 Yeah.
 Okay, so, that’s the admin part and then there’s the science part.
 Mm-hm.
 Then on top of that, I think what would be important is…uh…it’s important to have an open mind. Sometimes I—when I first started I was um—tsk, I used to assume very fast, a b—a bit too fast, then I realised that after a while…umm…if I sit down and listen…
 Mm.
 …to what people have to say, it helps a lot more. Because I realised that actually my initial assumption may not have been completely accurate.
 Ah.
 Especially about what others…other disciplines do. The way they work and this kind of thing, so I need to know a little bit more before I jump to the conclusion
 Mm. So an open mind is important.
 Yes. I think an open mind is important…uhh… I think uhh…identifying the common goal, thi—as a team, right, it is important to know what the common goal is, then it keeps the team together.
 Ahh. So being able to a—
 Yeah. To—
 Articulate.
 —articulate the goal and to make s—to see that everybody has the same kind of…the other thing of course is humour la, which I think it helps with the meetings ah.
 (laughs)
 Yeah, because a lot of times we, uhh…we have all these meetings and then we…are very tired ah, very tired then (laughs) then later we will actually talk about what…yeah…so…the other thing that I found was quite useful…was…showing that you’re willing to listen. Not just o—being open to ideas but also…really forcing yourself to sit down and say “What do you think about it?” You know, doing the—the thing that you’re actually taught to do, when you’re supposed to try and be open (stammering) you will actually d—practicing it Mm. So people tend to listen a lot more. And all these things like…I don’t know la, I don’t really know how—how to…
 So, actually the next thing I want to ask was, uhh…has anything in your clinical training prepared you for doing this?
 I think working in the ward…
 Ah.
 Uh, the ground work is very necessary. Because at the very least, I think the work in that—the work that I did…that—the s—the fact that I spent a long time in this hospital,
 Mm-hmm.
 And I did go out a bit but largely I spent in this ho—this hospital because I know the work processes better.
 Ahh, okay.
 Here, I’m more used to…“Oh, I know what is this, I know the reason why there is this problem, because this this this this.” Different hospitals have their own problems, but the fact is, because I’m s—the worked so long s—from the junior level all the way up, right, I do know…let’s say—this thing, I think will take a while to be done, I can prior—now prioritize because I know that it will take a long time for this one to be sorted out—
 Local knowledge.
 Yeah, local knowledge, I think that’s the—the way to say it, that’s correct. (laughs) Yes, that’s very correct. Um…clinical training wise…it is, of course…I think most specialties nowadays have this emphasis on multidisciplinary work. We stress it, some disciplines are better than others at practicing it, but the fact that we stress it a lot does help.
 Mm.
 Because we are taught much more than I think 30 years ago or something like that. That, um, working together with other people is very important.
 Ah.
 And we learn it from very junior stage, that when you…yeah. So, that’s—I think that’s quite important.
 Mm.
 Ahh….Yeah, and I think that’s—that’s en—enforced in many—most specialties nowadays
 Mm.
 So I—I think that—that part of the clinical was important. I think…at the slightly more senior level nowadays everybody needs to do a little bit of quality, a little bit of M&M,data collection, and I think because we’re doing all this work and a—n—a lot of it is in Tan Tock Seng, I don’t know whether all other hospitals are doing it because I’ve largely been here, …
 Mm.
 Umm…because you’re exposed to it from the time you’re a registrar and you hear that, oh, this—we’re doing this project in this hospital, we’re going to do this in that hospital, we’re going to do this...so you sort of know, oh yeah, the problems that you get, so I think in the clinical work, if  the department and the hospital is quite enthusiastic about such quality projects and improvement.
 Mm.
 Then it does help during your training too.
 Mm.
 Communication is also quite important.
