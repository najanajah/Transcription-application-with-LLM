Okay, great. Then I will start my record. Okay, maybe you first, you can start by just telling me a bit more about which were the electives that you chose during the lotte posting and what kind of teaching activities were you exposed to during that time?
Okay. The posting that actually asked emergency. I mean, with the use of point of care ultrasound. Yeah, so, sorry what was the question
Okay, so it was two weeks. What I asked was what was the electives? 
Yeah, so it was  GS together with emergency room posting and the emergency room one I think is specifically focusing on point of care ultrasound, right? 
Yup correct 
Okay, so there's like two weeks at the time now, right? 
Yeah, somewhat. 
Okay, okay. So the other question I wanted to know was so what kind of teaching activities were there during the posting? So was it like clinics? What rounds did you step out the hospital to like do home visits? What kind of teaching activities were there? 
Okay, so mainly for the G.S. side of it, mainly was clinics as well as we got to go to the OT a few times to observe that in the procedure. Yeah, we didn't get to join work rounds as much . So many, many clinics and OT and for the emergency department, we basically had certain shifts that we could join and mainly focused on learning how to do ultrasound like the fast scans and things like that. Yeah. Okay, okay. 
In terms of healthcare professionals, who did you interact with the most? I mean, it will be I guess G.S. would be the surgeons. 
Yeah. 
And then for EM, it will be the physicians in the ED. What are the healthcare professionals that you interacted with? 
Well, I think not so much actually. Yeah. Didn’t get a chance to get much other. 
So you're going ... I think you would say mainly the medical people. 
Mainly yea. Mainly more surgical. 
Yeah. I see. 
Okay. Maybe I want to ask now about the purpose of the posting. So what do you understand to be the purpose of this Lotte  posting? 
I think I mean what I want to understand about it is that it's supposed to be like how different disciplines work together. So I think for all the programs under lotte, like mainly with like G.S. as the focus and then with like some other discipline and how like what like brings these two together like that sort of thing. 
Yeah. What what were the different disciplines that were working together in the postings that you attended?
So my mainly G.S. and emergency. Yeah. Okay. I mean, okay, the T in lotte is for transdisciplinary, right? So I mean, before this posting, have you ever heard of the word like transdisciplinary? 
Not so much actually. I didn’t really have an idea of what it would be like. Okay. Okay. 
The posting actually helped to change your understanding or increase your understanding of what transdisciplinary meant. 
I think in only yes, I did like get a bit of understanding because sometimes like in the emergency department as well, we were able to see like maybe like for certain patients where they needed certain procedures, like chest tube insertion, then the surgeons would come down and then we got to like observe that interaction as well. I think it was like a good opportunity to see how they work together. Yeah. But I think mostly actually I mean, because mainly I thought that mostly maybe I'm not sure if it was like the particular program that I was in, but I feel like most of the time it was. Expresses separately like G.S. and emergency separately. So I saw a few instances of it like of the like transdisciplinary aspect of it. 
Okay. So I mean, having gone through the posting then. Are you in a position to better understand what's transdisciplinary? I mean, what? Okay. So like now that you finish the posting, what is your understanding of what transdisciplinary practice in medicine is? 
So I think yeah, I think I have a bit of a better understanding. So mainly like, yeah, basically how like different disciplines are work together for like how they involve together in the care of a patient.
 Okay. And I mean, what is so? What do you think is like the role of transdisciplinary practice in medicine? Is it important? Is it valuable? Why or why not? 
I think it's quite valuable because patients usually present with like multiple problems which cannot just be managed under one discipline. So it's quite important to have like multiple disciplines involved to like give a holistic care of the patient. 
Okay. Can you think of any example in your posting which actually show that, you know, that it is not just one discipline like G.S. that can cover everything or solve the patients’ problems. Well, that example is where you could see this coming true in the posting.
Oh, I think personally because I was doing the one with emergency, so I could see like how some patients after we see them in the emergency department. Then like, I mean, if it's relevant then the surgeons would like could be called and maybe involved in the care of the patients as well then they get transferred under the surgeons and then I was able to see like follow through with like how the patients were managed. 
Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm just thinking at any one time during the posting, did they explicitly say that, oh, this is about transdisciplinary practice and did they explain like what transdisciplinary means? Is a big complicated word, right? So did they explain what the term meant? 
I think maybe at the start of the posting, I think they did explain like basically like a overview of like what passes the new age and what to expect from the posting. Yeah. Okay. Okay. 
If I asked you to look back over the whole posting, what do you think was the most important lesson for you during the posting? 
Um, what's important lesson? Yeah. 
It doesn't have to be anything to do with either GS or EM in terms of like technical skills or medical knowledge. Okay. But if you think back on that posting, what was the biggest takeaway for you personally? 
I think the biggest takeaway for me was mainly the like the learning, the use of utlrasound  part cause not really something we are exposed to in like normal like medical school curriculum . So I think it was a very good opportunity to learn that because like I think it would be very useful for us in the future. 
So was that the highlight of the posting for you?
Yeah, for me, I would say it was okay. 
Um, could I ask you why you chose the posting? 
Okay, for me, I mainly wanted to, I mean it was many I wanted to like revise on my GS like my surgical knowledge and also like get exposed to like more patients and emergency side of things. Yeah. So that’s a main reason why I decided to try to take up the posting. Yeah. 
Okay. So what your expectations fulfilled at the end of the posting? 
Yeah. Okay. And yeah, the ultrasound part I wasn't like, I wasn't really sure what to expect. So it was good that like we had a lot of opportunity to learn that as well. Yeah, but I also managed to do the like revision part of it as well. Yeah. 
Okay. Um, I'm thinking about more of like the non medical or non medical/ surgical aspect of things like did the posting highlight to you how, um, healthcare professionals had to work with each other or how they had to interact with each other? Was any of those aspects..were any of those aspects highlighted to you during the posting? 
Oh. Yeah. I did learn like experience some instances of that  but I guess I wouldn’t really say that its something that stood out to me the most during the posting. But I did experience like instances where I saw like like different healthcare professionals having to work together. 
Okay. Yeah. I mean, would you be able to like give me some examples of why it was, no, you could, why it was just like a small part of it and not really a big part of the posting?
I think perhaps because like most of our days, how our posting was structured was that we got to choose some slots for like some shifts for the emergency department posting. So many when we were there we would like a tag along to one of the physicians to learn the ultrasound. And then we also had a supervisor on the surgical site and then for that bit we mainly followed like clinics and also went to the OT a few times. So I think like maybe it was a bit like separated in that sense. So maybe that’s a possible reason. 
Yeah. Okay. Okay. What do we by separated, um, separated from from what? 
As in separated as in like like the emergency and the surgical part of things like. 
Oh, okay. Yeah. They are not really intercolated with each other. It's like two weeks. Yeah. G.S. two weeks is a ED. 
Uh, something like that. Yeah. But I did see like a few instances of like the interaction , but yeah, maybe it was mostly like separated. Yeah. 
Okay. Okay. Okay. What are any negative experiences that you had during the posting? 
Oh. I would say that when a negative experience. Yeah. 
Okay. So I mean, do you have any suggestions on how this posting could be improved for future students? 
Uh. I think, uh, sorry, give me a minute. I think about it. Sure. I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think, uh, I think it was mostly good. I guess one small point would be that, uh, maybe if there were more, I'm not really sure how, like, this can be done. But if there were more opportunities to see like the, the interdisciplinary side of things, like, yeah, I think that would be good. Im not really sure like how that can be done as well. 
Okay. Um, I mean, what, what kind interdisciplinary things would you have like to see? 
Um, I think , I’m actually not I don't really have any examples in mind , but I'm aware that like, like, for the other posting standard program. Like, for example, the palliative care and the surgery one that, like, though, I think it was quite like, because the patients were, like, I mean, manage under both the surgeons and the palliative care teams. So I think, I think maybe if there's a fact that it was like, the emergency and surgery things so maybe there's like less chance for that, like, for me to observe the kind of interaction. So, yeah, not really sure, like, what, like, examples as well. 
Okay. Okay. No worries. So if I was asking you, you know, like, uh, how many out of 10, would you do this posting again? I mean, what, what kind of rating would you give, uh, this posting? 
Uh, I think maybe 8, yeah. 
Okay. Why, why 8? 
Uh, 8 because, uh, it was mostly like, uh, it was a good experience and, uh, I think I learned quite a lot. Uh, yeah. And can maybe like, uh, yeah, just, I guess maybe because of the fact that it was, uh, mainly, it is almost like two different postings. like, GS, and emergency. So, yeah, I think that's like all of these points. Yeah.
Okay. So the, the being 2, like different postings, that's a good thing in your opinion, right? Uh, was that, yeah, is that a good thing or a bad thing in your opinion? 
Uh, I think, uh, it was, I mean, there's nothing bad, like, maybe, I think we were being better. But I think it was, like, a few more opportunities to see some sort of like, uh, interaction. Okay. Yeah. But otherwise I mean, I mean, I think it's, it's okay. 
Okay. Okay. Thanks. Thanks. I've actually ran to the, the end of my questions. 
Do you have anything, um, else that you would like to highlight or to tell me about, uh, your experiences during the posting? 
Uh, no,  nothing else in particular. I think it was quite a good experience. 
Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you very much for your time then
